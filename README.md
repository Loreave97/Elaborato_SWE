University Project about Design Pattern

This project uses two design patterns: Mediator and Strategy.
The idea of this project is to automate the process of production, storage and sale by a store, a repository and a factory.
For each item sold by the store a certain supplying will be made from the repository, when the repository has few items in storage, it will ask for a supplying from the factory, which will produce the items according to a certain strategy.

This project can be improved by implementing the sale of different items and customized strategies for each item.
